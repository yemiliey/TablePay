# TablePay
Login to the wifi and pay your bill from the table

- Developed front-end interface with React.js and Redux. Experimented and came up with credit-card ecryption with Clover API
- The router at the restaurant can detect who is within its radius and logging into wifi, allowing us to email client with a link to our web app, which leverages Clover POS system to get the bill total and make payments by passing the securely encrypted clientsâ€™ credit card info. 
- Collaborated with coworkers and finished in a 2-day company-wise hackathon
